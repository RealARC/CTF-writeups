When we open up natas6 we're greeted with text that says "input secret" next to a box for us to type in. Under that is a button that says "submit" and in the corner theres a hyperlink that says "view sourcecode".
Well don't mind if I do, lets go check out this sourcecode.

Looking at the code we see the usual header that has "nothing to do with the level", but in the body section we have something interesting. A body of php code that reads as follows: 

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }

Now given my propensity for basic code reverse engineering, this seems like something right up my alley. Let me break this down so we can understand whats going on here.
The first line ( line 6 in this page) simply tells us the program to include a page at http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc into our proceeding code. Lets visit that address and see what else we can get here.

<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>

Great, now we have the secret password that gets ran through this code. Lets continue.
The second part of this (lines 8-12) is an if statement that says, if something has been submitted, and that thing matches the secret password, it will print the password for the next level for us; Otherwise it will print "wrong secret".

Well we already have the secret, lets go ahead and plug it in. 

Access granted. The password for natas7 is bmg8SvU1LizuWjx3y7xkNERkHxGre0GS


This one was pretty good. I like the conceot that it's teaching about code analysis.
Onto level 7.
