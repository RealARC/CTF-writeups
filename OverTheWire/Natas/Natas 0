Jumping right In to the first level and after logging in, I'm greeted by a very basic looking page with a box in the middle. Inside the box is the text "You can find the password for the next level on this page."

My first thought when I do in webpage analysis is always to check the page source and Inspect element to check for easy clues that might've been left there.

In the inspection panel, we have the basic html code for the page laid out, as i'd expect. 
Digging in to the codes header section revals the text "<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->". Fair enough, moving on.
In the body section, we see more commented out text that says "<!--The password for natas1 is 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq -->"

Easy enough for the first level. I get the sense that this is going to be a fun game.
